#README Code-Examples
Code-Examples contains a variety of coding projects I have worked on.
The majority the examples focus on some algorithms that I have developed.
The first of which is an algorithm to optimally solve the assignment problem
using the auction algorithm.  The second code snippet implements dijkstra's 
shortest path algorithm.  The algorithm utilizes a priority queue I developed 
using a min heap.
